One Step Job
A quick prototype and starter code for a friend's startup idea (which he dropped :)).
Idea was to create a job search app which will take one line introduction from the candidate
and show her relevant jobs in a Tinder like UI 
- Swipe Left and Right to move next
- Swipe Up to Apply
- Swipe Up to Save Job for later

__Please Note:__ This prototype has mock entries and flows to demosntrate UI functionalities but was written in a manner to be easily transformed into a fully functional app with API and Db integrations with least amount of redundant effort.
