One Step Job
A quick prototype and starter code for a friend's startup idea (which he dropped :)).
Idea was to create a job search app which will take one line introduction from the candidate
and show her relevant jobs in a Tinder like UI 
- Swipe Left and Right to move next
- Swipe Up to Apply
- Swipe Up to Save Job for later

__Please Note:__ The job entries are hardcoded at repository layer for now, but can be replaced easily with an actual API/DB implementation very easily
